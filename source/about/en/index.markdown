I am Steven Ko (柯俊宇)

I am a practicer of “Learning by doing”!

After graduated from Physics department，I felt I would like to do more realistic work instead of reading theory. And I couldn’t forget the happiness when I compiled my first C program. After consideration, I decided to apply computer science master program.

In Taiwan, every master student needs to do research. I found there are a lot of differences between “product development” and “research”. I was keen to learn new technology and implement it, instead of wasting my time in lab.

So after studied one year, I dropped out of school. I started to develop smart phone programs with my friends.

Motto：

    God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference.
